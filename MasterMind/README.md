# MasterMind Game

## Introduction

This project is a Python implementation of the classic game **MasterMind**. 
MasterMind is a code-breaking game where one player (in this case, the computer) generates a secret code, 
and the other player (the user) attempts to guess it within a limited number of tries. After each guess, 
the player is given feedback in the form of correctly placed colors and correct colors in the wrong position.

This project provides a simple command-line version of MasterMind that uses randomly generated codes, 
validates user guesses, and gives informative feedback until the game is won or the player runs out of attempts.

## How the Game Works

1. The computer generates a secret code made up of **4 colors** chosen from the following list:  
   `["R", "Y", "B", "G", "W", "O"]`  
   - **R** = Red  
   - **Y** = Yellow  
   - **B** = Blue  
   - **G** = Green  
   - **W** = White  
   - **O** = Orange  

2. The player has **10 tries** to guess the correct code.

3. For each guess, the game provides feedback:  
   - **Correct Position (POS):** Number of colors guessed that are in the exact correct spot.  
   - **Incorrect Position (POS):** Number of colors guessed that are in the code but in the wrong spot.  

4. The game ends when either:  
   - The player guesses the code correctly (wins).  
   - The player uses all tries without guessing correctly (loses).

## Project Files

This project currently contains only one Python file:  

### `MasterMind.py`
This file contains the full implementation of the game.  
It includes the following key components:

1. **Global Variables:**  
   - `COLORS`: The set of valid colors (`["R", "Y", "B", "G", "W", "O"]`).  
   - `CODE_LENGTH`: The length of the secret code (default = 4).  
   - `TRIES`: Maximum number of attempts allowed (default = 10).  

2. **Functions:**  

   - `generate_code()`:  
     Generates a random sequence of 4 colors from the list of valid colors.  
     This is the secret code the player must guess.

   - `guess_code()`:  
     Prompts the user to enter a guess.  
     Validates that:  
       - The guess is exactly 4 characters long.  
       - Each character corresponds to a valid color.  
     If the input is invalid, the user is asked to try again.  

   - `check_code(guess, real_code)`:  
     Compares the user's guess with the secret code.  
     - First, it counts the number of colors that are correct and in the correct position.  
     - Then, it checks for correct colors in the wrong position, ensuring that duplicate colors are handled properly.  
     Returns a tuple `(correct_pos, incorrect_pos)`.

   - `game()`:  
     Controls the game flow.  
     - Displays instructions and the list of valid colors.  
     - Generates the secret code.  
     - Loops through up to 10 attempts, checking the player's guess against the secret code.  
     - Provides feedback after each guess.  
     - Ends with a win or loss message depending on the outcome.

   - `if __name__ == "__main__": game()`  
     This ensures the game starts when the script is run directly.

## Example Gameplay

```
Welcome to MasterMind! You have 10 to guess to correct Color.....
The Valid Colors are: ['R', 'Y', 'B', 'G', 'W', 'O']

GUESS: RYBG
Correct POS: 2 | Incorrect Pos: 1

GUESS: WYGO
Correct POS: 4 | Incorrect Pos: 0
Congrats You in 2 tries....
```

## Design Choices and Considerations

1. **Input Validation:**  
   The `guess_code()` function strictly enforces that guesses must be 4 characters long and only contain valid colors.  
   This prevents invalid inputs from disrupting the game logic.

2. **Feedback Mechanism:**  
   The `check_code()` function was carefully designed to handle duplicate colors correctly.  
   For example, if the secret code has two "R"s and the player only guesses one, it should not overcount matches.  

3. **Simplicity:**  
   The project uses only Python’s built-in libraries (`random`), keeping it lightweight and portable.  
   No external dependencies are required.

4. **Replayability:**  
   Since the code is generated randomly each time, no two games are the same, increasing replay value.

5. **Command-Line Based:**  
   While graphical interfaces could be added in future versions, the CLI design keeps the project simple and accessible.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a classic logic and deduction game can be implemented in Python.  
It highlights problem-solving skills, input validation, and control flow management.  
Though currently a simple command-line game, it can be expanded into more advanced versions with features like GUI, 
multiplayer support, and enhanced user interaction.

The simplicity of the project makes it an excellent beginner-friendly programming exercise, 
while still offering room for significant enhancements and complexity.
